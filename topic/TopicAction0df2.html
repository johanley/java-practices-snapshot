<div class="page-title">Refactor large Controllers </div>

<br>Implementations of <code><a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/servlet/http/HttpServlet.html">HttpServlet</a></code> are sometimes informally called <em>Controller</em> classes (or <em>Action</em> classes).
They form the entry point of client HTTP requests into a web app.

<p>A common problem with Controllers is that they become too large.
Since the flow of control starts out in the Controller, there's a strong tendency to keep adding more and more code to the same place.
But that's usually a mistake.
You should not really think of the Controller as being in control.
Rather, you should think of the <em>Service</em> as being in control.
(From this perspective, the term Controller is a bit of a misnomer.)

</p><p>Here's a summary of the distinction between Controller and Service:
</p><ul>
 <li>the Service has the most important things: access to the database, and all associated data-logic and data-operations. 
 (In this context, the word Service is meant to include Data Access Objects.)
 </li><li>the Controller has the less important things: access to the incoming HTTP request, and the outgoing HTTP response.
 </li><li><b>the Controller's job is to be an input-output mechanism for the Service</b>: it translates incoming HTTP requests into usable data, and it forwards outgoing data to a JSP for a final HTTP response.
 </li><li>the Service is completely ignorant of HTTP.
 </li><li>for testing, the Service only needs access to the database; it doesn't need HTTP.
</li></ul>

As such, Controller classes should usually be fairly compact. 
If your Controller methods become large, or have service-logic in them, then you should consider moving that code into a Service class of some sort.

<p>(The distinction between Controller and Service can be more than just a desire for clear design.
When using the Spring framework, there are actually some important functional differences between Controller and Service classes.)
