<div class="page-title">Modularity and deletion</div>

<br>
In software, it's been recognized for a long time that <b>modularity is a guiding principle of lasting value</b>.

<p>In practice, it usually makes sense to <b>use the deletion test for modularity</b>.
It's a simple idea. 
To determine if a feature or aspect of a program is modular, just ask yourself this question: 
<em>How many steps does it take to delete this feature?</em>
The fewer the steps, the more modular it is.
If it takes only <em>one</em> step to delete a feature (usually by deleting a directory), 
then you can say that the design has maximum modularity.

</p><p>File systems are hierarchical, with directories within directories.
Given this basic fact of life, it's reasonable to have (as much as possible) a 1-to-1 mapping between the features of a program and directories/packages.
If this is done, the deletion of a feature can sometimes correspond simply to the deletion of a directory.
(This won't always be possible, but it's good to keep this idea in mind as a guideline.)

</p><p>A counter-example to this idea is what some call a <em>god class</em>.
By definition, a god class is related to a large number of features.
God classes are the opposite of modular, and should usually be avoided. 
An example of a god class is a class that does nothing but hold a large number of String constants that have similar meaning. 
Such a style emphasizes an implementation detail (<em>these are all similar Strings</em>) instead of emphasizing feature modularity (<em>String X is attached to feature Y</em>).
In this case, when you need to delete a feature, you usually also need to edit the god class in order to remove implementation details related to the feature.  
 
</p><p>
Some aspects of a program may have a <em>cross-cutting</em> character, in the sense that most features are related to it somehow. 
Take the example of security in an application (controlling which users/roles execute which code).

</p><p>There seem to be two choices for implementing security:
</p><ul>
 <li> security is itself treated as a separate feature. 
 In this case, your security implementation becomes a god class, since it will need knowledge of most of the other features.
 Some would view this with distaste.
 </li><li> each feature is responsible for its own security.  
 In this case, the implementation is modular. 
 Security becomes a part of each feature, and not separate from it.
</li></ul>
