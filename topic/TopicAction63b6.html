<div class="page-title">Design by Contract</div>

<br>The specification of a class or interface is the collection of non-private
items provided as services to the caller, along with instructions for their
use, as stated in javadoc. It's a challenge to construct a specification
which:
<ul>
<li>
is as simple as possible</li>

<li>
is as clear as possible</li>

<li>
has no ambiguity</li>

<li>
is completely accurate</li>

<li>
allows the reader to completely ignore implementation details (unless there
is a bug)</li>

<li>
pours understanding into the mind of the reader as quickly as possible,
with little chance for misunderstanding</li>
</ul>
Design By Contract is an effective guideline of lasting value for creating
a specification.
<p>The fundamental idea of Design By Contract is to treat the services
offered by a class or interface as a contract between the class (or interface)
and its caller. Here, the word "contract" is meant to convey a kind of
formal, unambiguous agreement between two parties.&nbsp; <i>C++ FAQs</i>
describes a contract as being made of two parts:
</p><ul>
<li>
<i>requirements</i> upon the caller made by the class</li>

<li>
<i>promises</i> made by the class to the caller</li>
</ul>
If the caller fulfills the requirements, then the class promises to deliver
some well-defined service.
<p>Some changes to a specification/contract will break the caller, and
some won't. For determining if a change will break a caller, <i>C++ FAQs</i>
uses the memorable phrase "<span class="highlight">require no more, promise no less</span>": if
the new specification does not require more from the caller than before,
and if it does not promise to deliver less than before, then the new specification
is compatible with the old, and will not break the caller.
</p><p>Although Design By Contract is a formal part of some programming languages,
such as Eiffel, it's not a formal part of Java. Nevertheless, Design By
Contract is very useful for designing classes and interfaces. It can both
guide the discovery of a more robust design, and allow more effective expression
of that design in javadoc.
</p><p>Requirements are simply any conditions on use, for example:
</p><ul>
<li>
conditions on argument values</li>

<li>
conditions on order of execution of methods</li>

<li>
conditions on execution in a multi-threaded environment</li>
</ul>
Requirements must be stated in javadoc, and may be enforced by throwing
checked or unchecked exceptions when the stated conditions are violated. Using 
assertions for enforcing requirements is <a href="TopicActionbf65.html?Id=100">not recommended</a>.
<p>Promises are stated in javadoc. They can be enforced by <a href="../home/HomeAction.html#Assertions">assertions</a>
at the end of a method.
