<div class="page-title">Using Tomcat for servlets</div>

<br><a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/">Apache Tomcat</a> is a widely-used servlet container.
A servlet container implements the servlet specification, and can serve Java Server Pages (JSPs).

<p>The following is a collection of reminders regarding its use.
It was created using Tomcat 8, but most of this should apply to later versions as well.

</p><h3>Getting Started</h3>
To start and stop the Tomcat server:
<ul>
 <li><code>bin/startup.bat</code> (<code>.sh</code> for Linux)
 </li><li><code>bin/shutdown.bat</code>
 </li><li>the default <code>ROOT</code> application is here: <code><a href="http://localhost:8080/">http://localhost:8080/</a></code>
 </li><li>note that Tomcat runs on a JRE. 
 You can use a JDK if you wish, but it's not necessary.
 For compiling JSPs, Tomcat uses its own internal compiler.
</li></ul>

<p>Tomcat comes with default configuration.
When changing that config, you should change the file minimally, and do only what you need. 
Leave the comments alone, for example, and don't rearrange things unnecessarily. 
Only then will a simple <em>diff</em> with the default config show where you've deviated from the defaults. 

</p><p>To understand and use Tomcat effectively during development, you need to understand two important ideas: 
</p><ol>
 <li>Tomcat <b>instances</b>
 </li><li>the difference between <b>reload</b> and <b>redeploy</b>
</li></ol>

<h3>Tomcat Instances</h3>
In Tomcat lingo, an <b>instance</b> is a directory that's separate from the Tomcat binary. It contains two things:
<ul>
  <li>config
  </li><li>optionally, apps (but the apps don't need to be here, and it's usually best that they just remain where they are.)
</li></ul>

There's not a <em>huge</em> difference between using an instance and not using an instance.
But, using an instance does have these advantages:
<ul>
    <li>it separates the Tomcat binary from config and apps (and even the apps can be separate, too).
    </li><li>you can have N Tomcat instances, as many as you want.
    </li><li>instances are easy to create, share, and use: they're just a few config files, and start-stop scripts that set up environment variables.
    </li><li>using N configs is trivial.
 You typically need at least 2 environments: dev and prod. 
 The config for prod is almost always different than that in dev.
 App reloading needs to be turned off in prod, for example, because it slows down the server too much, by repeatedly scanning the file system for changes.
    </li><li>changing Tomcat binaries, or versions of the JRE, is trivial when you use an instance.
    </li><li>an instance is a much smaller unit, without the binary, and even without the app source.
</li></ul>

In the Tomcat docs, you'll see many references to two important environment variables:
<ul>
    <li><b><code>$CATALINA_HOME</code></b>: location of the Tomcat <em>binary</em>
    </li><li><b><code>$CATALINA_BASE</code></b>: location of the Tomcat <em>instance</em>
</li></ul>
 If you're not using an instance, then <code>$CATALINA_BASE</code> is the same as <code>$CATALINA_HOME</code>.

<p>You can think of a Tomcat instance as a kind of mini-Tomcat. 
It mimics the same directory structure found in the binary install, and looks like this:
</p><pre>
 startup.bat [short scripts that you create]
 shutdown.bat
 conf [start with the same conf folder in the Tomcat binary]
   server.xml [main config; each instance needs its own shutdown port]
   web.xml [settings amalgamated with app web.xml]
   context.xml [settings amalgamated with app's context xml file]
   catalina.properties
   logging.properties
   tomcat-users.xml [used for simple access control]
   Catalina
     localhost
      [app context xml files, that point to your web app]
      [add/delete an xml file here is one way to deploy/undeploy an app]
 lib [database jar; jars shared between apps]
 logs
 webapps 
   [not really needed for deployment, but it's an option]
   [instead, put a context file in conf/Catalina/localhost]
 work [compiled JSPs and whatnot]
</pre>

So, the idea is that someone on your team sets up an instance, and all of its config, and then the Tomcat instance is shared with the team. 
The start-stop scripts are short. 
They simply set up environment variables, and then start the Tomcat binary.

<h3>Reload versus Redeploy</h3>
The second important idea is the distinction between <em>reload</em> and <em>redeploy</em>. 

<p>Reload of an app:
</p><ul>
    <li>is faster than redeploy, and is preferred for most development work
    </li><li>is triggered in various ways: changes to <code>web.xml</code> (via <code>WatchedResource</code>), or changes somewhere inside <code>WEB-INF/classes</code> (via the <code>reloadable</code> setting for the app's context xml)
    </li><li>reload preserves session data (by default)
    </li><li>by default, sessions are preserved by being saved first to the file system (serialized), then read back in when the app starts up again (deserialized).
  In order for this to work well, Java objects in the session need to implement <code>Serializable</code>.
    </li><li>as a user of the app, there's no need to log in again, re-navigate, and re-enter data. This saves a lot of time when you're developing.
    </li><li>Tomcat abandons the app's classloader, and starts over again with a new classloader for the app, by going back to the file system, where your app is located
    </li><li>the app starts up again from scratch
</li></ul>

<p>Redeploy of an app:
</p><ul>
  <li>if the app is running, it's stopped
  </li><li>completely removes <em>all</em> of its artifacts, and starts from the beginning
  </li><li>all items related to the app are abandoned and removed: sessions are lost in a redeploy, and internal, compiled versions of JSPs and tags are removed
  </li><li>the new app code is put in place
  </li><li>the app is started
</li></ul>

Summary of the possible operations:
<ul>
  <li>app-reload
  </li><li>app-stop, app-start
  </li><li>app-redeploy
  </li><li>server-stop, server-start
</li></ul>

By default, app-reload and app-stop/start will preserve sessions. 
App-redeploy will never preserve sessions.

<h3>Avoiding Slow Development</h3>
To avoid slow development:
<ul>
  <li>use actions that cause reload
  </li><li>avoid actions that cause redeploy
  </li><li>avoid hard-coding items in Servlet 3.0 annotations: in <code>web.xml</code>, mark the web-app top level node as <code>metadata-complete</code>. 
  If this is not done, then the container will need to scan upon startup every class and jar in your app, to search for annotations and <code>web-fragment.xml</code> files. 
  That's slow.
</li></ul>

<h3>Context Files</h3>
A context is simply a web app. 
It forms part of a Tomcat instance. 
An app's context xml file instructs Tomcat how to deploy the app:
<ul>
    <li>the location of the code
    </li><li>the connection pool needed by the app (or similar resources)
    </li><li>any other config params
</li></ul>

Here's an example of a context xml file (note that its <code>reloadable</code> setting is not suitable for prod):
<pre>
&lt;Context docBase="/some/dir/" reloadable="true"&gt;
 &lt;Resource 
 name="jdbc/MYDatabase" 
 auth="Container" 
 type="javax.sql.DataSource" 
 driverClassName="com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerDriver"
 username="someusername"
 password="somepassword"
 url="jdbc:sqlserver://my_database_server_url"
 maxTotal="10"
 maxIdle="5"
 /&gt;
&lt;/Context&gt;
</pre>

The file is located in <code>../conf/Catalina/localhost/mywar.xml</code>. 
(It can also be embedded in war file itself, at the conventional location <code>META-INF/context.xml</code>.)
This will map the app to the URL <code>localhost:8080/mywar</code>. 
By default, it simply takes the path from the name of the file. 
If the context points to a war file, instead of a directory, then by default Tomcat will explode the war into its <code>webapps</code> directory.

<p>Note the default naming convention used by Tomcat uses the same name (<code>blah</code>, in the following example) in 3 places:
</p><ul>
 <li>the name of the war file: <code>blah.war</code>
 </li><li>the name of the context file in the <code>conf</code> directory: <code>conf/Catalina/localhost/blah.xml</code>
 </li><li>the URL path under which the app is deployed: <code>localhost:8080/blah</code>
</li></ul>


<h3>Manager Application</h3>
Tomcat's Manager application lets you 
<ul>
 <li>stop-start your apps, or redeploy them
 </li><li>view basic memory stats for the Java Runtime
 </li><li>other miscellaneous tasks
</li></ul>

If you want to use Tomcat's Manager application, you will need to edit two files. 
First, <code>conf/tomcat-users.xml</code>. Add the following:
<pre>&lt;?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?/&gt;
&lt;tomcat-users&gt;
  &lt;role rolename="manager-gui"/&gt;
  &lt;role rolename="manager-script"/&gt;
  &lt;role rolename="manager-jmx"/&gt;
  &lt;role rolename="manager-status"/&gt;
  &lt;user username="admin" password="admin" roles="manager-gui, manager-script, manager-jmx, manager-status"/&gt;
&lt;/tomcat-users/&gt;</pre>

Next is the Manager app's context file. 
By default, it's located in <code>/webapps/manager/META-INF/context.xml</code>, and it defines an IP filter, that restricts it to the <code>localhost</code> only. 
You may need to change or remove that restriction.
<pre>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;Context docBase="${catalina.home}/webapps/manager" antiResourceLocking="false" privileged="true"&gt;
  &lt;Valve className="org.apache.catalina.valves.RemoteAddrValve" allow="127\.0\.0\.1" /&gt;
&lt;/Context&gt;
</pre>
Here, the <code>allow</code> param is actually a regular expression.

<h3>Useful Configuration Items</h3>
Ideally, these setting should be done once, by a single developer, and then shared with the others on the team.
Tomcat is configured using xml files and properties files:
<ul>
   <li> <code>server.xml</code> (this is the main config file)
   </li><li> <code>web.xml</code> (amalgamated with your web app's <code>web.xml</code>)
   </li><li> <code>context.xml</code> (amalgamated with your web app's context file)
   </li><li> <code>logging.properties</code> (JDK loggers)
   </li><li> <code>catalina.properties</code>
</li></ul>

Some settings to consider in <code>server.xml</code> ('#' means it's a default setting):
<ul>
 <li><code>Connector.compression="on"</code> - gzip textual output from the server, if the client supports it (which, these days, they all do, in practice). 
 </li><li><code>#Connector.URIEncoding="UTF-8"</code>
 </li><li><code>Connector.disableUploadTimeout="false"</code>
 </li><li><code>Connector.connectionUploadTimeout="600000"</code>
 </li><li><code>#Connector.useBodyEncodingForURI="false"</code> 
 </li><li><code>#Connector.connectionTimeout="20000"</code> - defaults to 20 seconds in <code>server.xml</code>
 </li><li><code>#Connector.maxThreads="200"</code>
 </li><li><code>#Connector.minSpareThreads="10"</code>
 </li><li><code>#Connector.SSLEnabled="false"</code> - if true, you need to set other things as well: <code>.scheme="https" .secure="true"</code>, port, and so on
 </li><li><code>#Host.autoDeploy="true"</code> - true in dev, false in prod
 </li><li><code>Host.deployOnStartup="false"</code>  - false in dev, true in prod
 </li><li><code>Host.deployXml="false"</code> - deploy using xml files in <code>META-INF/context.xml</code>, in the app, instead of outside the app
 </li><li><code>#Host.unpackWars="true"</code> - explode war files into directories; faster to serve files this way
</li></ul>

<p>Some settings in <code>context.xml</code>:
</p><ul>
 <li><code>Context.deployOnStartup="false"</code> - false in dev, true in prod
 </li><li><code>Context.reloadable="true"</code> - true in dev, false in prod (the default)
 </li><li><code>Context.logEffectiveWebXml="true"</code>  - combines all settings: app <code>web.xml</code>, app annotations, container settings; prod should always have this on; outputs to the <code>catalina</code> log
 </li><li><code>Context.Parameter</code> - as <code>context-param</code> in <code>web.xml</code>, but without editing <code>web.xml</code>; overrides <code>web.xml</code> by default.
 </li><li><code>Context.Environment</code> - as above, but for data accessible by JNDI
 </li><li><code>Context.Listener</code> - hooks into Tomcat; could record startup times, for instance
 </li><li><code>Context.Manager</code> - in prod, Tomcat recommends changing from <code>StandardManager</code> (the default) to <code>PersistentManager</code>
 </li><li><code>Context.Manager.Store</code> - needed by <code>PersistentManager</code>, but not by <code>StandardManager</code>
</li></ul>

<h3>Parallel deployment</h3>
Parallel deployment means you deploy two versions of the app side by side, with a version number in the name of the war file (<code>myapp##001.war</code>). 
Existing sessions continue to be handled by the old version of the app, while new sessions go to the new version of the app. 
Users migrate over from the old world to the new world, simply by logging in again.
Of course, the idea is to have zero downtime during a production upgrade.  

<p>Things to consider:
</p><ul>
    <li>database changes that may be incompatible with one version of the app
    </li><li>log file names need to have a version number as well
    </li><li>possible interaction with config data stored in memory
    </li><li>in an emergency, you can even remove the new version, and revert to the old
    </li><li>practical advice <a href="http://java-monitor.com/forum/showthread.php?t=1288">here</a>
</li></ul>

<h3>Setting up HTTPS and SSL</h3>
Ideally, this should be done only once, by a single developer, and then just distributed to the others on the team.
<p>Once you have a certificate in a local keystore file, edit <code>server.xml</code>, and add a second <code>Connector</code>, for use with SSL. 
</p><pre>
&lt;Connector port="8443" protocol="org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11NioProtocol"
    maxThreads="150" SSLEnabled="true" scheme="https" secure="true"
    clientAuth="false" sslProtocol="TLS" keystoreFile="conf/mykeystorefile" keystorePass="changeIt"/&gt;</pre>

The above <code>Connector</code> is a second <code>Connector</code>. 
You leave the existing non-SSL <code>Connector</code> in place. 
The non-SSL <code>Connector</code> will be used for apps that don't require SSL. 
In addition, if an app does require SSL, and a request URL for that app erroneously uses HTTP (and not HTTPS), 
then Tomcat will use the <code>Connector.redirectPort</code> setting of the non-SSL <code>Connector</code>, and the browser gets 
redirected to the secured <code>Connector</code>, running on a different port.
 
<p>The <code>keystoreFile</code> path can be absolute; if relative, it's relative to <code>$CATALINA_BASE</code>.
Self-signed certificates can be used only informally: they encrypt traffic, but they can't help with authentication or authorization.
When you use them, your browser will give you a warning, and you'll need to explicitly instruct the browser to accept the certificate.

</p><p>The default HTTPS port is 443, not 8443. A warning from the docs:
<br><em>"special setup (outside the scope of this document) is necessary to run Tomcat on port numbers lower than 1024 on 
many operating systems [eg Linux]."</em> 

</p><p>After you've finished configuring Tomcat for SSL, restart Tomcat, and navigate to a URL in your app (changing <code>http</code> to <code>https</code>).
