<div class="page-title">Avoid JavaBeans style of construction</div>

<br>Some argue that to construct a <a href="TopicActiond08d.html?Id=187">Model Object</a> in many steps, first by calling
a no-argument constructor, and then by calling a series of <code>setXXX</code>
methods, is something to be avoided, if possible:
<ul>
<li>
it's more complex, since one call is replaced with many</li>

<li>
there is no simple way to ensure that all necessary <code>setXXX</code> methods
are called</li>

<li>
there is no simple way to implement a <a href="TopicAction0d31.html?Id=6">class invariant</a></li>

<li>
it allows the object to be in intermediate states which are not immediately
useful, and perhaps even invalid</li>

<li>
it's not compatible with the (very useful) <a href="TopicActiond838.html?Id=29">immutable
object</a> pattern</li>

<li>
it does not follow the style of many design patterns, in which concrete
classes usually have arguments passed to their constructor. This is a recurring
theme in the <i>Design Patterns</i> book. Constructors usually act as a
"back door" for data which is needed by an implementation, but which cannot
appear in the signature of some higher-level abstraction (since it would
pollute such an abstraction with data specific to an implementation).</li>
</ul>
Of course, JavaBeans follow this pattern of "no-argument constructor plus
<code>setXXX</code>".
However, JavaBeans were originally intended for a very narrow problem domain - manipulation 
of graphical components in an IDE.
<span class="highlight">As a model for the
construction of typical data-centric objects (Model Objects), JavaBeans
seem completely inappropriate</span>. One can even argue strongly that, for Model Objects,
the JavaBeans style is an <i>anti-pattern</i>, and should be avoided unless
absolutely necessary.

<p><b><em>"The JavaBeans pattern has serious disadvantages."</em> - Joshua Bloch, <em>Effective Java</em></b>

</p><p>
</p><hr width="30%">

If you need more convincing, read on.

<p>Here is the definition of a Java Bean, directly from the original <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/spec-136004.html">specification</a>:
</p><p><b>"A Java Bean is a reusable software component that can be manipulated visually
in a builder tool."</b>

</p><p>This is very clear and simple. No mention is made here, or anywhere else in the 
specification, of Model Objects used to encapsulate database records. The whole idea 
of a Model Object is entirely absent from the Java Bean specification, and for good reason: the manipulation of 
graphical controls and the representation of database records are unrelated issues.

</p><p>The life cycle of a Java Bean, starting with its no-argument constructor, is derived mainly from 
the task of <em>configuring</em> a graphical control having some default initial state. 
For the intended domain, this is indeed a reasonable design. 
For <a href="TopicActiond08d.html?Id=187">Model Objects</a>, however, the idea of <em>configuration</em> in this sense is entirely meaningless. 

</p><p>The role of a Model Object is to carry data. Since a no-argument constructor can only build an object that is initially 
empty, then it cannot contribute directly to this aim. It does not form a natural candidate for the 
design of a Model Object.

</p><p>To put data into empty Java Beans, frameworks typically call various <code>setXXX</code> methods using reflection. 
There is nothing to prevent them from calling constructors in exactly the same way. 

</p><p>A demonstration that a framework does <em>not</em> need JavaBeans for its Model Objects is 
found in the <a href="TopicAction5f31.html?Id=188">WEB4J</a> tool. WEB4J calls (surprise, surprise) a constructor to 
build Model Objects. It recommends implementing Model Objects as <a href="TopicActiond838.html?Id=29">immutable objects</a>, 
not Java Beans.

</p><p>The widespread adoption of Java Beans as a supposedly appropriate design for Model Objects seems to be an error.
