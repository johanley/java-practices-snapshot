<div class="page-title">Thread safety in web apps</div>

<br>
In a web application, you should verify that the following items are 
safe for operation in a multi-threaded environment:
<ul>
 <li>servlet classes
 </li><li>servlet filter classes
 </li><li>items placed in application scope
 </li><li>items placed in session scope
</li></ul>

<p>Many applications use a framework. Frameworks usually define the servlet class, and 
the thread-safety of those servlets will be explicitly stated by a well-documented framework.
Many frameworks require the application developer to define <em>actions</em> or <em>controllers</em> for implementing features. 
In this case, the framework owns the servlet, and the servlet in turn uses your action/controller objects.
Some frameworks will create your action objects on the fly, on the single thread assigned to handle a single request. 
This in turn means that your actions will be confined to a single thread; thus, in this case, your action classes 
will have no need for thread-safety. 

</p><p>An example of a framework which violates this rule is Struts 1. 
In Struts 1, your actions must be designed for operation in a multi-threaded environment. 
This can be considered a defect, since <b>ensuring a class is thread-safe is both non-trivial to implement and easy to forget</b>.

</p><p>A second example of a framework that can insist on thread-safety is Spring. 
In Spring, <em>by default</em>, objects managed by the Dependency Injection container are singletons, and need to be thread-safe.
If this bothers you, then at least you have the choice in Spring of changing the "scope" in which objects are used.

</p><p>In the case of servlet filters, a framework is not usually used when defining them. 
In this case, you have to be careful that your servlet filter class 
is indeed safe for operation in a multi-threaded environment.

</p><p>For objects placed in either application scope or session scope, the simplest design
is to ensure that the object is <a href="TopicActiond838.html?Id=29">immutable</a>, such that external synchronization
is never necessary.

</p><p>It's clear to most people that objects placed in application scope will be accessed by more than one thread. 
However, even objects placed in <i>session</i> scope can also be used by more than one thread.
From the Servlet Specification:

</p><p><i>"Multiple servlets executing request threads may have active access to a single
session object at the same time. The Developer has the responsibility for
synchronizing access to session resources as appropriate."</i>

</p><p>Here are some ways in which multiple threads might access the same session:
</p><ul>
 <li>web apps containing multiple servlets can share access to the same session
 </li><li>Ajax requests from a single client
 </li><li>multiple browser windows on a single client
 </li><li>repeated clicks on a submit button
 </li><li>using HTML frames to request multiple pages at the same time
</li></ul>
